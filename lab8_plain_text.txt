No man is an island entire of itself
every man is a piece of the continent
a part of the main
If a clod be washed away by the sea
Europe is the less
as well as if a promontory were
as well as if a manor of thy friends
or of thine own were
Any mans death diminishes me
because I am involved in mankind
and therefore never send to know
for whom the bell tolls
it tolls for thee

No Man Is an Island by John Donne
